### Project Prerequisites

#### 1. **Basic Knowledge of JavaScript and React**

- Understanding JavaScript fundamentals, especially ES6+ syntax.
- Familiarity with React concepts such as components, state, props, and lifecycle methods.

#### 2. **Node.js and npm**

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for running JavaScript code outside a browser.
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Helps manage project dependencies.
- You can install Node.js (which includes npm) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). For this project, it’s recommended to use Node.js version 16 or above.

To verify the installations, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### 3. **Docker (for Containerization)**

- **Docker** is required to containerize the application. This enables the app to run in isolated environments across different platforms, making deployment easier.
- Install Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

After installation, confirm it’s working by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

#### 4. **Docker Hub Account (Optional, for Pushing Images)**

- A **Docker Hub account** is recommended if you plan to push the container image to Docker Hub.
- Sign up at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/), and ensure you have your username and password available for logging in via the command line.

#### 5. **Git (for Version Control)**

- Git is essential for managing your code and collaborating with others. If not installed, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

Verify the installation:

```bash
git --version
```

#### 6. **Basic Understanding of Nginx (for Production Setup)**

- **Nginx** is used in this project as a lightweight web server for serving the React app in production. Some familiarity with Nginx configurations can be helpful, though it’s not required to start.

| Software | Version               | Purpose               |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Node.js  | 16 or above           | JavaScript runtime    |
| npm      | Included with Node.js | Dependency management |
| Docker   | Latest                | Containerization      |
| Git      | Latest                | Version control       |

With these prerequisites, you’ll be ready to clone, run, containerize, and deploy the application. Let me know if you need additional details on any of the prerequisites!

## Docker Creation

Now that you have the prerequisites set up, you can proceed with creating the Docker container for the application. Detailed instructions on how to create and manage the Docker container can be found in the [Docker.md](https://github.com/Junnygram/chess-container/blob/main/Docker.md) file.
