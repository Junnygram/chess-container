Sure! Here’s your updated section with the link to the Docker documentation and the GitHub repository included:

### Project Prerequisites

#### 1. **Basic Knowledge of JavaScript and React**

- Understanding JavaScript fundamentals, especially ES6+ syntax.
- Familiarity with React concepts such as components, state, props, and lifecycle methods.

#### 2. **Node.js and npm**

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for running JavaScript code outside a browser.
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Helps manage project dependencies.
- You can install Node.js (which includes npm) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). For this project, it’s recommended to use Node.js version 16 or above.

To verify the installations, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### 3. **Docker (for Containerization)**

- **Docker** is required to containerize the application. This enables the app to run in isolated environments across different platforms, making deployment easier.
- Install Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

After installation, confirm it’s working by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

#### 4. **Docker Hub Account (Optional, for Pushing Images)**

- A **Docker Hub account** is recommended if you plan to push the container image to Docker Hub.
- Sign up at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/), and ensure you have your username and password available for logging in via the command line.

#### 5. **Git (for Version Control)**

- Git is essential for managing your code and collaborating with others. If not installed, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

Verify the installation:

```bash
git --version
```

#### 6. **Basic Understanding of Nginx (for Production Setup)**

- **Nginx** is used in this project as a lightweight web server for serving the React app in production. Some familiarity with Nginx configurations can be helpful, though it’s not required to start.
