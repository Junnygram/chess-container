run locally then build before then copy th ebuild folder into nginx seerver in your dockerfile ,, to avoid issues 


Hereâ€™s the step-by-step guide for running your React app locally, building it, and then copying the build folder into NGINX in the Dockerfile to avoid issues.

### 1. **Run the React App Locally (for Development)**

Before creating the production build, you should run your app locally to test and make sure everything is working properly.

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the development server. Test your app thoroughly and ensure it's ready for production.

### 2. **Build the React App for Production**

Once you're satisfied with the local development, build your React app for production.

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates an optimized production build in the `build/` folder. It will contain static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that are ready to be served by NGINX.

### 3. **Create the Dockerfile for NGINX**

Now, create a `Dockerfile` to containerize your React app with NGINX:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official NGINX image as the base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the custom NGINX configuration file if needed (optional)
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Remove the default NGINX HTML files and copy the React build folder into NGINX's html folder
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/* 
COPY build/ /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start NGINX in the foreground
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### 4. **Build the Docker Image**

Next, build the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t your-app-name .
```

This command creates the Docker image by copying the React build files into the NGINX server.

### 5. **Run the Docker Container**

Once the image is built, run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 your-app-name
```

Your React app will now be served by NGINX at `http://localhost`.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Run the React app locally** to test and ensure it's working (`npm start`).
2. **Build the app** for production (`npm run build`).
3. **Create a Dockerfile** that copies the `build/` folder into NGINX (`COPY build/ /usr/share/nginx/html/`).
4. **Build the Docker image** (`docker build -t your-app-name .`).
5. **Run the Docker container** and access the app via NGINX (`docker run -p 80:80 your-app-name`).

This ensures you're serving the optimized production build of your React app via NGINX in Docker, avoiding development-related issues.
